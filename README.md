Artificial Neural Network for Regression Tasks

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) using TensorFlow. The model is designed for regression tasks and includes the following features:

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Uses StandardScaler to normalize input data.
Model Architecture: Built with TensorFlow/Keras, optimized for regression.
Training Process:
Tracks metrics such as loss and mean absolute error (MAE).
Includes validation during training to monitor model performance.
Prediction: The model generates predictions for new input data.
Results

The notebook includes:

Training logs showing a decrease in loss and MAE over 50 epochs.
Validation results demonstrating model generalization.
Example predictions on test data
